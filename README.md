A pure client side implementation of Gist.io

This is a JavaScript implementation of [Idan Gazit](http://gazit.me/)'s [Gist.io](http://gist.io/).
To read more about the motivation for this, please see Idan's description of Gist.io.
This is just a port, the original idea is Idan's and inspired from Mike Bostock's [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org)

## Usage
1. [Create a Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and copy the ID. The id will be a number like **6756799** for public gists and a key like **4f0b868e8fd13f77f10e** for private gists.
